What on earth is this?
=====================

This is AnnoyJanken, an attempt to create the most annoying game of Janken 
(aka. Rock-Paper-Scissors) ever. The game tries to learn the opponents 
behavior and predict their actions. 

This depot has been divided into 2 parts: a proof-of-concept python script
and an Android app.


But why?
========

For the lulz. I read some articles on how this could be done and decided
to try my wings on an implementation of my own.


I still need more info...
